## 1.7.2 - 2022-01-27

## 1.7.1 - 2022-01-24

### Fixed

- Lock @babel/parser to 7.16.8 to avoid performance issues introduced with 7.16.10

## 1.7.0 - 2022-01-10

## 1.6.1 - 2021-10-20

### Added

- Support obfuscating babel's safe public class fields output, added the corresponding `obfuscateBabelSafePublicFields` option.

## 1.2.0 - 2020-05-06

## 1.1.0 - 2020-04-28

### Added

- Add the "safeMode" option

## 1.0.7 - 2020-04-07

### Changed

- Update the escodegen dependency to npm so no git is required to use the optimizer.

## 1.0.6 - 2019-12-13

### Fixed

- Added a workaround for compatiblity of the Optimizer webpack plugin with `@angular-devkit/build-angular`versions greater than `0.802.2`.

  Since version `0.803.0`, the angular plugin resets the compiler host after the first module build, which interferes with the two-pass approach of the Optimizer plugin. As a workaround, the Optimizer plugin now activates webpack's watch mode when an angular webpack plugin is present. This prevents the reset call.

## 1.0.5 - 2019-08-22

### Fixed

- Fix obfuscation of [extra properties in option overloads](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/framework_option_overloads_extra_properties)
